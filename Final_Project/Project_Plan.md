## Topic Discussion

The overall topic of the project will include investigating how a host of Big Data technologies could be leveraged to improve multiple facets of the growing and distribution process for indoor farmers. One of the biggest benefits of growing indoors is the ability to precisely control the growing environment. From the light intensity and spectrum, to the nutrients given to the plant, there is an optimal combination of variables that produce the best results. Each farmer has priorities, whether those are yield, produce quality or a combination of various factors, it is a complex system that requires experimentation and robust tools to see the best results. There are a host of IoT sensors and controllers that can be employed to help monitor and control the growing environment, these all produce vast amounts of data that must be sifted through to extract insights. For sizeable farms, this produces big data problems that must be overcome. 

While some insights from the data can come during or directly after the growing “season”, some requires the produce to hit the shelves or to be used to create various food products. This means monitoring continues through the logistics process, and this data is integral when it comes to the end result of the produce. 

The end goal is to investigate and implement a scalable solution that follows the farmers crops from seed to consumers tables and optimizes the process along the way. Although indoor farms allow for great control, it is important to understand that there are many costs that are not associated with traditional farms. This means that to make the farming endeavor sustainable, optimization is important.
